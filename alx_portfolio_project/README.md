    <h2>How this project was inspired</h2>
    <p>This project was inspired by our personal experiences and observations. At times some of us have encountered the challenge of locating specific products within a town, whether it be a new environment or our own familiar surroundings. It often involves traversing numerous corners of the town, only to find the desired item elusive or priced differently than anticipated.</p>
    <p>Motivated by these encounters, we created MarketMate, a web application designed to facilitate the process. MarketMate empowers shops to showcase their products alongside their respective prices. Subsequently, users gain access to a comprehensive database, enabling them to swiftly locate desired items. This innovative solution aims to streamline the shopping experience, saving valuable time for all involved.</p>

    <h2>Some User Stories Behind</h2>
    <p>As a very busy businessperson, I rarely get enough time to walk around the market and search for the products I want. Most of the time, I’m always calling different shops to check if they have what I need. Almost every time I find myself calling more than 7 shops just to confirm one product.</p>
    <p>Because of this, I want to always browse through the website until I find the product I want and pin the location. This will guarantee a 1-call checkup, saving me a lot of time. Also, I will be able to pick up the product or anybody I send it to without wasting a lot of time.</p>
    <p>I travel to new towns almost twice a month to make my business flourish. This has posed a challenge to me whenever I want to purchase something. Being in a new place becomes a problem when I want to buy something. I always end up moving up and down through the town or inquiring information from locals like a madman. Sometimes I don’t even find what I want in 1 day, but in 2 days.</p>
    <p>I will be happy if I will be able to just sit down comfortably and locate the product I want. This will save me time. This will also give me enough room to instruct my Uber driver where I want to go instead of just walking by foot because I don’t know my destination.</p>
